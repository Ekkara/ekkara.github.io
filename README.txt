# Computer store

Computer store is a small web project used to demonstrate my understanding of html, css and most importantly JavaScript. 
In this project you pretend to save up money to buy a pc, or simply take a loan to do so (with some restrictions)

## Features
working to earn a currency, transfer money from one account to another, take a loan with some restrictions (such as not 
too much or not multiple loans), view several laptops, purchases one laptop 

## Installation
The user should not need to install anything more than a modern web-browser, at which they can visit the website from. 
Developer need some form of text editor and open the project in that. Personal preference is the visual code
there are many good ones out there. No library should b required.

## Usage
Use the buttons provided, additional needed information will be provided by the website.
